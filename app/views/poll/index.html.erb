  <h2 class="blog-post-title">How a Journalist Created the Number One Restaurant in London</h2>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">March 16, 2021 by Anonymous</p>

  <p>The Shed at Dulwich was a fake restaurant created as a hoax by journalist Oobah Butler
     for Vice magazine. It became the top-rated restaurant in London on TripAdvisor before
     the listing was taken down.</p>
  <p>The restaurant was located in a garden shed in Dulwich, London.. It was open 
     only for one night in November 2017 where it did manage to serve ten guests,
     including a couple from California.</p>
  <p>The faux menu theme was "moods", and Butler photographed plates of food created
     using household products including shaving foam and dishwasher tablets. An example
     of a mood menu item was the following:</p>   
  <blockquote>
    <p>Empathetic: Vegan clams in a clear broth with parsnips, carrots, celery, and potatoes. Served with rye crisps.</p>
  </blockquote>
